## Disclaimer


While this command displays a bunch of links to [Kamihime Database](https://kamihimedb.thegzm.space), they are indeed NSFW links and is against Discord Guidelines if shared on non-NSFW channels.

If you want to use this without setting up the nsfwchannel, either DM the bot (e.g: `hareminfo arthur`) or use the site directly.

## Using This Command Normally (Server Manager only)


`@Eros set nsfwchannel` must be set or I will decline your request.

`@Eros set nsfwrole` must be set if you would like me to assign NSFW role to gain access to the NSFW channel.

`@Eros set loli` is optional if you hate embedding loli contents from the game. Toggle-able command.

## Using This Command Normally (everyone)


`@Eros nsfw` to request access to NSFW Channel and I will assign a role to you. This is only available if the `nsfwrole` is set.

## Examples

```
@Eros hareminfo eros
@Eros hareminfo mars
