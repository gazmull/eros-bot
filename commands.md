# Commands


`help [command]` will display brief information and `guide` command will display newbie-friendly information of the command specified.

Make sure you gather information for that command on both `help` and `guide` commands!



Still not clear enough? Submit an issue [**here**](https://github.com/gazmull/eros-bot/issues)

## Critical Tip


Texts that are enclosed with `[]` or `<>` meant they are placeholders.

You use it as **`@Eros info eros -tw`**, not as **`@Eros info <item name> [flags]`**!



`[]` means __optional__ | `<>` means __required__
