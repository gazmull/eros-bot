## (Drumicube and Eunicorn)'s Legacy
Here are some of commands and functions inherited from `kamihime-bot` with additional tweaks:

- Added [**`insult`**](https://thegzm.gitbook.io/eros/commands/fun/insult) fun command (formerly `kbaka`)
- Added [**`quiz`**](https://thegzm.gitbook.io/eros/commands/fun/quiz) fun command (formerly undocumented and automated function)
- Added [**`Basic Leveling System`**](https://thegzm.gitbook.io/eros/leveling-system) (derived from `kudos`. Instead of `kudos points`, it's `EXP and Titles` now)
- Added [**`search flags`**](https://thegzm.gitbook.io/eros/commands/kamihime/info) (formerly `/kh Parameters`. e.g: `-k` `--kamihime` to `-tk` `--type=kamihime` / `-r` `--releaseweapon` / `-p` `--preview`)

With this section, it is a signal for `kamihime-bot` to completely shutdown. Thank you for your support! *manly tears*
