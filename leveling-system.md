# Leveling System


With Leveling System (or LS in short), enjoy your stay in the server for gaining EXPs and titles by participating in LS-featured commands, and communicating with fellow server members!

## Current LS-featured Commands

## How It Works


Commenting in a server channel will grant you up to 10 EXP while using LS-featured commands will grant you up to 1000 EXP.

If an LS-featured command is triggered by a user with __Manage Server__ permission, the EXP reward will increase by 500 points.

If you want to know your current level, see `@Eros level info` 

## What are Those Unique Titles?


They are sort of achievements on how active you are in that server.

The highest title can be achieved at 1.000.000 EXP. Later versions may include titles with more than a million EXP requirment.

Your title may vary in each server.
