# Commands


`help <command name>` will display information about a command.



Still not clear enough? Submit an issue [**here**](https://github.com/gazmull/eros-bot/issues)

## Critical Tip


Texts that are enclosed with `[]` or `<>` meant they are placeholders.

You use it as **`@Eros info eros -tw`**, not as **`@Eros info <item name> [flags]`**!



`[]` means __optional__ | `<>` means __required__

---

Some commands that has multiple arguments can take an argument that has spaces, only if the argument is surrounded by double quotes.

Example: **`@Eros tag edit "am i joke to you" i think so`**

Where `"am i joke to you"` is the tag name while `i think so` is the tag content.
