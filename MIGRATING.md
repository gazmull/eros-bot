## help
While there are no changes in the command usage, the details differs:
- Kamihime Bot: Gives very detailed explanation for every command.
- Eros: Gives short and technical information, however this has been reinforced with `?guide` command and/or the [**web documentation**](https://docs.thegzm.space/eros-bot).

---

## kh
Nothing much changed, however `flags` (or `parameter` from `Kamihime Bot`) is different to make way for the new `flags`:
- Kamihme Bot: /kh Amaterasu --kamihime -k
- Eros: ?kh Eros --type=kamihime -tk

### New Flags From Eros
- `--preview` / `-p` Show image
- `--release` / `--releases` / `--releaseweapon` / `-r` **Exclusive for Kamihime/Weapon** â€” Show the release weapon / kamihime release instead
- `--accurate` / `-a` Tells the bot the given name immediately resolves to a character/weapon name (e.g: `?kh Eros -a`).

---

## kp
While there are no changes in the command usage, the details differs:
- Kamihime Bot: Displays information provided by the user.
- Eros: Displays information provided by Discord, and stats provided by Leveling System.

---

## countdown
Most sub commands did not change, however there is a usage change to `countdown add`, and `/countdown format` has been renamed to `?countdown help`:
- Kamihime Bot: /countdown add An Event 1970-01-01T00:00
- Eros: ?countdown add 1970-01-01T00:00 An Event

### New Countdown Features From Eros
- Countdown notifications system added. See how to set this up [**here**](https://thegzm.gitbook.io/eros/commands/countdown/countdown-subscribe).
- Countdown command `test` is now usable for everyone.
- Countdown command `current` has been added. This shows the current time in Nutaku Server Time (PST/PDT).

---

## kbaka
While there are no changes in its function, the command usage differs:
- Kamihime Bot
  - Can only be used by authorised personnel.
  - /kbaka \<@username>
- Eros
  - Can be used by everyone, however `--stalk` flag (the behaviour of `/kbaka`) can only be used by authorised personnel.
  - ?insult \<member> [--(un)stalk]

---

## kudos
While not really inherited, `Leveling System` has similar traits to `/kudos`: building up your reputation.
- Kamihime Bot: /kudos \<@username>
- Eros: Automated by the bot; core command is `?level`. Check your progress with `?level info`. [**More info about Leveling System**](https://thegzm.gitbook.io/eros/leveling-system)
