## Pull Request

### Documentation / Guide
> Since this still involves building the source code, please read [**Code**](#Code) first.
1. Proceed to [`src / commands / general / guide-pages`](src/commands/general/guide-pages).
    > If you are writing to a general guide (not a command guide), feel free to edit `index.ts` once you're inside the folder mentioned above.

    > If you are writing to a command guide, proceed to [`commands`](src/commands/general/guide-pages/commands).
    1. Select a category (e.g. `general` or `kamihime`).
    2. Go to `assets` and you should see `.ts` file for each command.
        > Feel free to either edit the file or create a new oneâ€” if it's a valid command within the bot.
### Code
> When adding/updating a command, `guide-pages` must be updated. See [**Documentation / Guide**](#Documentation-/-Guide)
1. Fork this repository, clone to your machine, and then follow the project's development configuration [e.g. TSLint]

    > Failing build will be rejected at default.
3. File a [**Pull Request**](https://github.com/gazmull/eros-bot/compare).

  2. Run `$ yarn run dev:start`
